# UNFINISHED

>**Description**: I want to make something fun with the camera. Maybe like a snapchat filter.
UPDATE: bare minimum done. Face recogition and filters not implemented yet. Right now it is a camera app that tries to catch you flinching to two locally stored videos. Backend and filters planned to be implemented later.
